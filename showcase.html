            <h2>Project 1: Tasteful Bites Online Ordering System</h2>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Web Developer</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The restaurant had no online ordering system, limiting sales and customer reach.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Designed and implemented a full-stack online ordering platform. The system allowed customers to view the menu, place orders, and receive confirmation emails, increasing revenue by 30% within 3 months.</p>

            <h2>Project 2: Social Media Engagement Campaign</h2>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Digital Marketing Specialist</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The restaurant had minimal social media presence, resulting in low brand awareness and customer engagement.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Developed a targeted marketing campaign across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter/X. Content included interactive posts, weekly specials, and user-generated content promotions. Engagement and followers doubled within 6 weeks, driving more online and offline traffic.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Restaurant Digital Transformation Web App</h2>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Full-Stack Developer & UX Designer</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> "Tasteful Bites" needed a modern digital platform for bookings, customer feedback, and social media integration. The restaurant wanted to improve customer engagement and streamline operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Created an interactive web app (now featured in the Problem-Solving page) that allowed customers to submit bookings, give feedback, and easily access social media channels. This reduced administrative workload and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Concept:</strong> 
                The layout emphasizes **simplicity and usability**. I structured the page in modules for bookings, feedback, and social links so users can quickly find and complete actions. The form uses client-side validation (JavaScript) to ensure accurate submissions, while the visual design matches the restaurant’s branding colors (#ff7043 accent) and maintains a clean, readable style.
