<h2>Project A — Restaurant Digital Transformation (Problem-Solving Page)</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> CTO / Lead Developer (project owner)</p>
<p><strong>Problem addressed:</strong> The restaurant relied on phone calls and paper notes for bookings and feedback, causing missed reservations and slow customer response. No social presence or easy contact options existed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution & outcome:</strong> I designed and implemented a lightweight website with clear contact details, social links, and an interactive booking/feedback form that generates an email directly to restaurant staff. This cut manual handling time and provided a reliable electronic trail for bookings. The site prioritised accessibility and progressive enhancement so it works on low-end devices and smart phones.</p>
<p><strong>Design concept for the Problem-Solving Page:</strong> The Problem-Solving Page was structured to follow the user journey: discover (social links & contact details), act (clear booking form), and confirm (auto-generated email via mailto). I used minimal fields to reduce friction (name, contact, request), accessible labels, and client-side validation. The mailto approach was chosen because the assessment brief forbids live databases — it provides immediate, actionable messages sent to staff without requiring server-side code. The page emphasises clarity and speed to encourage bookings and feedback, improving customer engagement with minimal technical overhead.</p>

<h2>Project B — Online Menu & Specials</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> Front-end developer</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Customers couldn't view the latest menu or daily specials online, resulting in missed opportunities to upsell seasonal dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Built a responsive menu page and a small admin-editable JSON feed for menu items. The restaurant reported higher enquiries about specials and saw an increase in walk-in orders for items promoted online.</p>

<h2>Project C — Staff Scheduling Dashboard (Group Assignment)</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> Team developer (group project)</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Manual scheduling led to clashes and inefficient shift allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Created a simple JavaScript-driven scheduling UI to visualise shifts and export schedules as CSV. The prototype reduced scheduling conflicts in the test group and formed the basis for further work.</p>
